Maintenance Release 1.5
=======================

This is the fifth release of the xde-icons package that provides

This release is a maintenance release that removes some unnecessary
icons that conflict with the packages that utilize them.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release
for more information.  Please report problems to the issues list on
