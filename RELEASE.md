Maintenance Release 1.4
=======================

This is the fourth release of the xde-icons package that provides
desktop icons for the _XDE (X Desktop Environment)_.  It provides the
necessary icon sets to work with XDE tools as well as supporting the
desktop entries in the xde-helpers package.

This release is a maintenance release that simply provides better
autoconf directory defaults and improves the build system more.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release
for more information.  Please report problems to the issues list on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bbidulock/xde-icons/issues).
